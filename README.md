# pi-frame
Experimental picture frame app(s) for Raspberry Pi. Each app is a different approach. The goal is to use the HDMI out interface to cycle through a series of pictures on a customizable sequence. 

## pi-frame-gtk
This app is for Raspian and uses GTK 3.0 for UI. It's meant to be a fullscreen app on startup. Mirage would have worked similarly, but it doesn't repeat its slideshow or have any customizable interval.
